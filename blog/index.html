                <p> 
                    Recently, through making this website, I've been thinking quite a bit on
                    what I value in design. There are clearly many, many different perspectives
                    on this, certainly at least as many as there are people who have an opinion on the
                    topic, as no two people think exactly alike. Yet despite the very diverse set of 
                    opinions, there are certain concepts in design that stand out to both
                    creators and consumers alike which are as simple as they are valuable, though often
                    just as hard to apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've read my about-me, you might already know the foremost concept I'm referring to,
                    structure. The foundation. It might seem too simple to even mention, and it has been
                    mentioned many times before. But like so many other core concepts in life and in work,
                    it can never be mentioned enough. In fact, it is often neglected despite
                    being so familiar. This might be due to ignorance, such as believing that the foundation
                    of the project is solid, despite having holes that someone with more experience could
                    identify. It could also be sacrificed for the sake of time, or simplicity, or laziness.
                    Whatever the reason might be, a weak foundation is, definitionally, a dangerous
                    thing to build on, and the product will show its weakness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers are very familiar with the term "technical debt", and I'm sure most
                    would confide that they're much too familiar with its consequences. On most
                    large codebases, and even smaller projects, having some degree of
                    technical debt is considered to be pretty much unavoidable. Making changes to an already
                    well-defined and organized system is often challenge enough. Without that structure,
                    it can become a seriously daunting and time-consuming task. The scariest part is, this
                    isn't even the structure that I'm chiefly concerned about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, I want to assume that the process of making the product is flawless.
                    The technical debt accumulated throughout it is almost nonexistent. Everything and everyone
                    moves like a well-oiled machine. Is the product created a success?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know that I haven't given any information on what this product is, how the market
                    for something like it is, who it's intended for, why it was created, or really
                    any relevant information on it at all. That wasn't very fair. The point is, all of
                    those things that might have influenced the product's success are directly tied to
                    its structure. What is this product? Are "what it is" and "what it does" well defined?
                    What needs does it meet? Can its creation and distribution cause any issues?
                    All very simple questions, but if not answered carefully, each has the potential to
                    seriously damage the product's effectiveness and lifespan, to say nothing of its
                    "success", which we haven't yet defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found myself needing convincing that this is a topic worth writing on, as I thought
                    through this. I think it's only fair that I begin with my own experiences as an example
                    of incomplete planning leading to a lackluster result. One of my first group projects
                    provides the best example of this. We were a small team with plans to work on, vaguely,
                    a dungeon-crawler game. We were assembled as part of a university course, not having
                    known each other previously, but undoubtedly a team with the necessary skills
                    for completing the task ahead of us. The planning stage went by quickly, with little
                    realistic structure created, but many design documents and deliverables drafted.
                    We moved forward having developed little more than
                    a dubious understanding of the gameplay we wanted,
                    some entertaining character names,
                    and plans to create custom character sprites,
                    none of which made it into the final game.
                    In the production stage, the lack of direction given by the almost
                    nonexistent foundation led to uninformed decisions on the implementation of core
                    features, overlapping tasks, and pushed back completion deadlines. Team members who
                    had worked less in the codebase found it challenging to contribute features, given the
                    convoluted mess that it had devolved into. It took a massive refactoring effort towards
                    the end of the production stage to salvage any comprehensibility in the codebase.
                    This is certainly an extreme example, as we were inexperienced developers working with
                    low deliverable requirements and an incredible amount of technical debt in a small
                    project... but I would argue that this isn't such an extreme result given the shocking
                    lack of structure in a potentially semester-long project. To give an example closer to
                    the ideal that I described, I'll provide my experience on a hackathon project that I
                    contributed to recently. This project was not nearly as well structured as some others,
                    but the concept was well-defined and the path to production clear. Production was chaotic,
                    but not much more chaotic than other 48-hour deadlines I've experienced. 
                    It was a test of the flexibility of the team, and especially of our lead developer,
                    but we were able to deliver a very respectable product. I'll say that I
                    was impressed with how the web application turned out, and very proud of my team, but
                    I know that most people say the same about their projects. More helpfully, I thought that
                    the application performed almost exactly as I had hoped it would when we planned its
                    foundation. So, was this project successful? The product was, to my mind, identical to how
                    I imagined it at the beginning. The multiplayer was easy to understand and
                    engaging. The webpage was minimally decorated, but polished. But no, at least in the context of
                    the hackathon, it was not successful. Why exactly is not something I asked the judges for,
                    but it's pretty easy to give some solid reasons. Our project only loosely applied to a minor
                    topic in the hackathon's topic list. Our game relied on familiarity with coding, quick
                    decision making, and for the average player, multiple attempts to learn the game to a
                    point where playing it was satisfying. Our game did not have the foundations of a successful
                    hackathon entry. Even if what was built on top was as designed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, those are a few examples from my experience, at least through coding. And I could
                    easily bore you with many more, programming or otherwise, not to brag. And if you have
                    never failed to create a good foundation before, or if you will never fail again,
                    I sincerely apologize for having wasted your time with this entry. The thing is,
                    creating a good foundation is hard. And it's a process that many, many people are still
                    trying to improve. So I'd argue that no matter what, a good reminder can't hurt. Even
                    huge companies with hundreds of eyes overseeing development still struggle with this.
                    The game industry has produced quite a few games that the public felt relied much
                    too heavily on graphics or game feel, all but abandoning objectives and story.
                    The importance of a solid structure might be easily understood, but it definitely
                    isn't easy to create, at least not without experience. I hope that this motivates the
                    discussion some, even if only to newer students or professionals, as it is something
                    that I'm still trying to learn daily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went off on that aside before defining success. Sorry about the huge cliff-hanger.
                    Success looks different in every situation, that is a given. For a product that intends
                    to make profit, success is being profitable. I think an even easier metric to think
                    theoretically about is intent and delivery. I'm not a business owner, and what I
                    make is not intended to turn a profit. But when I design a project, I want it to
                    be rooted in meaningful intent, and I want my delivery to match that intent as
                    closely as possible. To that end, deeply planning and laying a strong foundation is
                    paramount. I hope that framework, that mindset, can help you recenter your perspective
                    on doing and creating what's meaningful to you.
