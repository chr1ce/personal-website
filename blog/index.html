                    One of the foremost values in design is structure. The foundation.
                    It might seem too simple to even mention -- In fact, it's so familiar that it is
                    too often neglected. This might be due to ignorance, such as believing that the
                    foundation of the project is solid, despite having holes that someone with more
                    experience could identify. It could also be sacrificed for the sake of time,
                    or simplicity, or laziness. Whatever the reason might be, a weak foundation
                    is a dangerous thing to build on, and the product will show its weakness.
                    The struggle is, in a busy world with a plethora of external pressures,
                    it can be hard to define what a strong foundation is, even if it might be easy to
                    imagine its benefits. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we can start implementing the principles of a good foundation in our projects,
                    we need to first define more than the broad concept of structure. We need to understand
                    some of the deeper concepts embedded in it. I provide the three that have stood out to
                    me the most. First, the direction behind the creation of the structure, the intent.
                    Second, how we arrive at the structure necessary for a specific project, the planning.
                    And third, the path through development, the delivery. These outline what we want to create,
                    how we want to create it, and how we ensure that what we create is what we intended and
                    designed. Forgetting the intent leads to a product with little relevance or purpose.
                    Neglecting the planning leads to chaotic production and reluctant compromises.
                    Unclear delivery causes slow production and a frustrating development environment,
                    even assuming the project had strong intent and deep planning.
                    This is the framework that I find helpful in identifying how to approach
                    the structure of my work. There are many other factors in the real application,
                    but if each of these factors are theoretically strong, the project is much less
                    easily swayed by those external troubles.

                <p>
                    This has all been very broad, and it has been broad for a reason.
                    I find that starting from a distance provides useful perspective when looking
                    closer at individual issues, and is more applicable to a larger set of issues.
                    Here, though, I want to apply this framework to my specific field of computing and
                    programming to give a closer view. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some pretty clear direct relationships between common tech company
                    standards and the three categories I presented.
                    Every successful product has gone through rigorous design and planning.
                    To find relevance in the market, professionals must determine what needs
                    can be met by the product and how profitable meeting those needs
                    can be -- the intent of many of these products is different compared to
                    those of a passion project created by a small group of developers.
                    There are market pressures and investor interests to consider, as well as companies'
                    toes to avoid stepping on (or to commit wholeheartedly to stepping on).
                    Furthermore, for these large teams, defining delivery is a trickier task.
                    Miscommunication is harder to sort out, misaligned deadlines can cut into
                    developing features, writing documentation, or testing.
                    The company might even place less value in project management and oversight in general.
                    With multiple teams working separately, and sometimes out of sync,
                    orchestrating between them becomes increasingly difficult,
                    and proportionately more valuable. This is far from the ideal situation
                    free from external factors, but products with clear intent and rigorous
                    planning find success. Not every product with sound structure succeeds,
                    of course, but we certainly don't see top products without that strength behind them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing is, creating good structure is rarely, if ever, a matter of perfection.
                    Even those huge companies with hundreds of eyes overseeing development still
                    struggle with this. It's often more of a question of how well you can use what you have,
                    to achieve what you need. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Success looks different in every situation, but ultimately,
                    following sound principles to create solid structure can only strengthen the
                    end product. When I design the structure of a project,
                    I want it to be rooted in meaningful intent, and I want my delivery to
                    match that intent as closely as possible -- and this only happens with
                    planning tying them together. This framework helps me orient my perspective
                    on creating meaningful work.
